## surveyProject- an exercise in utilizing R as a mean to visualize and analyze data.

# Figure One explores the relationship between hindfoot length and weight per species. Scatter plot was used to visualize the data with variation in dot color representing the various species represented

# An ANOVA test was run on this data to determine if there was a relationship between the weight of the animal and its hindfoot length.

# Figure Two explores the average weight per year of collection utilizing a line graph

# Figure Three explored the distribution of weight in males with no filters except for NA

# Figure Four was the same as Figure Three, but limited the weight to those 100 or less.  This was to create a graph that represented the majority of the data.

# Figure Five was a challenge given to create a series of graphs that looked at the distribution of weight in males by species.
